## 📖 Background  

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) form the **backbone of India’s economy**:  
- Contribute **30% of GDP**.  
- Employ over **110 million people**.  
- Yet, **90% of them run on guesswork**, not data.  

📉 This gap between **ambition and tools** leaves billions of rupees in untapped opportunities.  
We built **नफाNuksan** to bridge this gap.  

---

## ❌ Problem Statement  

- **Data Chaos**: Insights buried in Excel sheets, GST portals, Tally exports, and invoices.  
- **High Costs**: Data analysts cost ₹10–20 lakhs annually — unfeasible for most SMEs.  
- **Missed Opportunities**: Without insights, businesses mismanage inventory, fail to forecast demand, and lose customers.  

👉 Bottom Line: SMEs have **limitless ambition** but **limited tools**.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

## ⚙️ How It Works  

**3 Magic Steps**:
